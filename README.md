# Proxi

This is an Application solution to the problem: Networking at large events is difficult because you may forget to grab someones contact information or business card.

I designed the mobile application using Expo and React-Native for the front-end client side. For the backend I used the Node.JS and Express.JS and connected it to a MongoDB database that stored all of the information that the client side would need to access and perform certain funcationalities. This app looks the best as a mobile applciation.

## Starting the Applciation / Front-end

1. cd into the front-end folder
2. You will have to install some dependencies:
   - npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @expo/vector-icons axios

3. run npx expo start (tag)
   - You can add the following tags:
   - (web): to run on as web application
   - (--android): to run on an andoird emulator on your device
   - (--ios): to run on a IOS emulator
   
## Starting the Application / Back-end

1. cd into the server folder
2. Install node.js, express.js, cors, and mongoose (npm install or whatever you choose)
3. run npm devStart

To simplify the Proxi mobile application, it is a medium-high fidelity prototype that allows the user to walk through the entire sign-up process.

This project was done in collaboration with the Northeastern University class ENTR 3330: Design Thinking for Startups. Based on their specifications I fine tuned the UI to match the deisgn the had in mind and to the best of my abilities, I made certain features of the app funcational.
