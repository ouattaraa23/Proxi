# Proxi

This is an Application solution to the problem: Networking at large events is difficult because you may forget to grab someones contact information or business card.

I designed the mobile application using Expo and React-Native for the front-end client side. For the backend I used the Node.JS and Express.JS and connected it to a MongoDB database that stored all of the information that the client side would need to access and perform certain funcationalities. This app looks the best as a mobile applciation.

## Starting the Applciation / Front-end

1. cd into the front-end folder
2. You will have to install some dependencies:
   - npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @expo/vector-icons axios

3. run npx expo start (tag)
   - You can add the following tags:
   - (web): to run on as web application
   - (--android): to run on an andoird emulator on your device
   - (--ios): to run on a IOS emulator
   
## Starting the Application / Back-end

1. cd into the server folder
2. run npm devStart

To simplify the Proxi mobile application, it is a medium-high fidelity prototype that allows the user to walk through the entire sign-up process.
